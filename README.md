# _RE-STREET_

#### The API for RE-STREET
#### [Client-side Repository](https://github.com/rita-morozova/restreet-frontend)

## Description

RE-STREET is an art-platform for street artists. Here artists can find locations of legal walls and email owners to reserve a wall for their future masterpiece. Also, if someone knows an available  walls location, they can share it with the community by placing a pin on the map. Users can get some inspiration by contemplating modern art. Each piece of art has a color palette showing the colors used to make it. Users can create their own moodboard by liking paintings from the gallery page. Users can watch video lessons, create notes while watching lessons and create their own library with favorited videos. Also, users can share their own art by uploading pictures and sharing them with the community. Users can also show some love to other artists by liking their photos.
